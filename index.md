# Jaime Xu's First CS193 Homework

```markdown
**Some of my favorite things about CS193**
- I get to learn very important aspects of computer science that I will need alongside my programming knowledge
- I learned to use the terminal and GitHub on my own after this class stressing me to do so, two essential things that any programmer should know how to do, except I never learned because I was never pressured enough to do so
- The TAs appear knowledgable and relatable
- The class does not appear to be a lot of work, and each assignment and lesson seems to be worth the time
